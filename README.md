# Mobile-Version-Portfolio
ADD CONTACT ME FORM
- This section of the project involved adding contact form to the portfolio project.
- It was a collaboration project which my partner and I invited each other for a collaboration to build a contact form that can be used to give feedback.
- In the form we used https://formspree.io/ as our collection tool for feedbacks.
- Also, when building the form we had to set restrictions such as without filling all required fields a user cannot be able to submit the form.

## Built With

- HTML/CSS linters
